# About Me

Hello, my name's Jordan and I'm a programmer from Southern Illinois. In my free time, I do let's plays on YouTube and I stream on Twitch with a group of friends on the Alderoth Circle. I keep a more general blog for open-ended thoughts as well as canonical pages on games I play, movies I watch, etc. On those, I like to review them or post any notable thoughts I had.
